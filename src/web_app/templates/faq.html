                <div class="px-4 pb-4">
                    <p>The rating system is based on an advanced skill rating algorithm designed to evaluate a player's
                        strength and track their progress over time. The system uses performance data from matches to
                        adjust a player's rating dynamically, accounting for the difficulty of opponents and the
                        outcomes of each game. This ensures that the ratings are accurate and reflect the true skill
                        levels of players within the community. Unlike the popular <a
                            href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo-Zahl" target="_blank">Elo rating system</a>, which
                        was initially designed for chess, the skill algorithm we use here is designed to support games
                        with more than two players. For more details on the mathematical principles behind this system,
